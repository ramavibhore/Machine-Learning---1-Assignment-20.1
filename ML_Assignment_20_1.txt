1. What are the three stages to build the hypotheses or model in machine learning?

Three stages to build hypotheses or model in machine learning are:
[A] Building a model
[B] Test that model
[C] Apply the model


2. What is the standard approach to supervised learning?

If training is leveled such as an input where the desired output is known, in that case supervised learning is approachable.
For example, any historical data which is leveled , supervised learning can predict some future events using that datasets.

3. What is Training set and Test set?

Training dataset is a dataset which is used to train a model. Any specific feature can be picked up from training set
and using that feature , model should be able to learn something if training set is leveled correctly.

Test dataset is used to measure how well the model is performing to make predictions. If the prediction score for the Test
set are unreasonable, then we can adjust the model and try again.

4. What is the general principle of an ensemble method and what is bagging and
boosting in ensemble method?

Ensemble method is a machine learning technique that combines several base models in order to produce one optimal 
predictive model.

Bagging is combination of Bootstrapping and Aggregation to form one ensemble model. Given a sample of data, multiple 
Bootstrapped subsamples are pulled. A decision tree is formed on each of the Bootstrapped subsamples. After each 
subsample Decision Tree has been formed , as algorithm is used to aggregate over the Decision Trees to form the most
efficient predictor.

Boosting is a two-step approach, where first one uses subsets of the original data to produce a series of averagely 
performing models and then "boosts" their performance by combining them together using a particular cost function.

5. How can you avoid overfitting ?

We can avoid overfitting using 
[A] Lots of data
[B] Cross-validation
